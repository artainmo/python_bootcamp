42AI [subject](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python).

In this python bootcamp we learn about the use of python and its specific libraries in relation to data-science such as numpy and pandas.<br>
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.<br>
Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

To learn more about the learned theory, read the comments inside the code.
