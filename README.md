# python_bootcamp

42AI [subject](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python).

In this python bootcamp we learn about the use of python (day00-02) and its specific libraries in relation to data-science such as numpy and pandas (day03-04).

Numpy is a library, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.<br>
Pandas is a software library for data manipulation and analysis.<br>
Python and its data-science libraries numpy and pandas have implications for AI.

To learn more about the learned theory, read the code and its comments. Research what you don't understand.

Here are extra resources to learn more about programming in python that present notions lacking in this bootcamp:<br>
