42AI [subject](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python)

In this python bootcamp we learn about the use of python and its specific libraries in relation to data-science such as numpy and pandas.<br>
Numpy is a library, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.<br>
Pandas is a software library for data manipulation and analysis.<br>
Python and its data-science libraries numpy and pandas have implications for AI.

To learn more about the learned theory, read the comments inside the code.
