    def compare_box_plots(categorical_var, numerical_var): #displays a series of box plots to compare the distribution of the numerical variable in each possible value of the categorical variable. There should be as many box plots as there are possible values of the categorical variable. For example, with Sex and Height, we would compare the distribution of height between men and women with two box plots.

    def compare_histograms(categorical_var, numerical_var): #displays separate histograms of the numeri- cal variable for each category represented in the categorical variable. As a bonus, you can make it display overlapping histograms of different colors.
